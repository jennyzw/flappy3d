1. explain
2. demo
3. issues/improvements

topics
- geom (bunny, pipes, background) (J)
- positioning pipes, random # height
random top height, subtract from whole scene height to get bottom height

- animation bunny moving down, pipes moving left (TAng)
- user interaction bunny jump

~*~*~*~DEMO~*~*~*~

issues
- jumping while falling (TAng)
- intersect bounding boxes (J)
iterate through array of pipe sets, got top/bottom objects by name, created boxes for each of them

- moving bounding boxes along with animation (TAng)

- getting the score (J)
calculated score by counting how many pipes passed (some math)
- UNSOLVED ISSUE: stopping animation

improvements for version 2, mostly aesthetic and UI things
- smoother jumping (J)
- harder level ideas (TAng)
